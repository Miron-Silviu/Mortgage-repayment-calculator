## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

## What I learned

Building this project I learned:

1- How to semantic define HTML elements, by building blocks of codes for header, main and footer.
2- Creating style.css I learned how to use css object oriented, mobile first apporch, BEM and implement the DRY principle.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<form action="get">
  <fieldset>
    <label for="amount">Mortgage Amount</label>
    <input type="text" id="amount" name="mortgage" value="Â£" />
    <label for="team">Mortgage Team</label>
    <input type="text" id="team" name="years" value="years" />
    <label for="rate">Interest Rate</label>
    <input type=" text" id="interest" name="rate" value="%" />
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .amount_label,
  .team_label,
  .interest_rate_label {
    color: var(--Slate-100);
    font-weight: 500;
    font-size: 1rem;
    margin: 1rem 0 0.5rem 0;
  }
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```
